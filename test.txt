anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates selfgoverned societies based on voluntary institutions these are often described as stateless societies although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on nonhierarchical or free associations anarchism holds the state to be undesirable unnecessary and harmful
while opposition to the state is central anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations anarchism is usually considered a farleft ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects antiauthoritarian interpretations of communism collectivism syndicalism mutualism or participatory economics
anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy many types and traditions of anarchism exist not all of which are mutually exclusive anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications
the word anarchism is composed from the word anarchy and the suffix ism themselves derived respectively from the greek ie anarchy from anarchos meaning one without rulers from the privative prefix ἀν an ie without and archos ie leader ruler cf archon or arkhē ie authority sovereignty realm magistracy and the suffix or ismos isma from the verbal infinitive suffix izein the first known use of this word was in 1539 various factions within the french revolution labelled opponents as anarchists as maximilien robespierre did the hébertists although few shared many views of later anarchists there would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs
the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierrejoseph proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the midnineteenth century since the 1890s and beginning in france the term libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states on the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism
the earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century bc among the works of taoist philosopher laozi and in later centuries by zhuangzi and bao jingyan zhuangzi s philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist zhuangzi wrote a petty thief is put in jail a great brigand becomes a ruler of a nation diogenes of sinope and the cynics as well as their contemporary zeno of citium the founder of stoicism also introduced similar topics jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the christian anarchist tradition georges lechartier wrote the true founder of anarchy was jesus christ and the first anarchist society was that of the apostles in early islamic history some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the islamic civil war over the caliphate where the kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the islamic society
the french renaissance political philosopher étienne de la boétie wrote in his most famous work the discourse on voluntary servitude what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent the radical protestant christian gerrard winstanley and his group the diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in england the term anarchist first entered the english language in 1642 during the english civil war as a term of abuse used by royalists against their roundhead opponents by the time of the french revolution some such as the enraged ones began to use the term positively in opposition to jacobin centralisation of power seeing revolutionary government as oxymoronic by the turn of the 19th century the english word anarchism had lost its initial negative connotation
modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the enlightenment particularly jeanjacques rousseau s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom
as part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the french revolution william godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought according to peter kropotkin godwin was the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work while godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early edmund burke
godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism he argued in political justice 1793 that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance he thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power rather he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution
his aversion to the imposition of a rulesbased society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the people s mental enslavement the foundations of law property rights and even the institution of marriage he considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation in each case government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement
the french pierrejoseph proudhon is regarded as the first selfproclaimed anarchist a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work what is property published in 1840 it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory he developed the theory of spontaneous order in society where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests his famous quote on the matter is liberty is the mother not the daughter of order in what is property proudhon answers with the famous accusation property is theft in this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propriété where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish he contrasted this with what he called possession or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use however proudhon later added that property is liberty and argued that it was a bulwark against state power his opposition to the state organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time
the anarchocommunist joseph déjacque was the first person to describe himself as libertarian unlike proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature in 1844 the posthegelian philosopher max stirner published in germany the book the ego and its own which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism french anarchists active in the 1848 revolution included anselme bellegarrigue ernest coeurderoy joseph déjacque and proudhon himself
in europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848 during which ten countries had experienced brief or longterm social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings after most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists liberals and nationalists along with anarchists to prevent further revolt in spain ramón de la sagra established the anarchist journal el porvenir in la coruña in 1845 which was inspired by proudhon s ideas the catalan politician francesc pi i margall became the principal translator of proudhon s works into spanish and later briefly became president of spain in 1873 while being the leader of the federal democratic republican party according to george woodcock these translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of spanish anarchism after 1870 but before that time proudhonian ideas as interpreted by pi already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860 s according to the encyclopædia britannica during the spanish revolution of 1873 pi y margall attempted to establish a decentralised or cantonalist political system on proudhonian lines
in 1864 the international workingmen s association sometimes called the first international united diverse revolutionary currents including french followers of proudhon blanquists philadelphes english trade unionists socialists and social democrats due to its links to active workers movements the international became a significant organisation karl marx became a leading figure in the international and a member of its general council proudhon s followers the mutualists opposed marx s state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings woodcock also reports that the american individualist anarchists lysander spooner and william batchelder greene had been members of the first international in 1868 following their unsuccessful participation in the league of peace and freedom lpf russian revolutionary mikhail bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the first international which had decided not to get involved with the lpf they allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the international who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivisation of property at first the collectivists worked with the marxists to push the first international in a more revolutionary socialist direction subsequently the international became polarised into two camps with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads bakunin characterised marx s ideas as centralist and predicted that if a marxist party came to power its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against
anarchist historian george woodcock reports the annual congress of the international had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the paris commune and in 1871 the general council called only a special conference in london one delegate was able to attend from spain and none from italy while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the fédération romande – was used to avoid inviting bakunin s swiss supporters thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present and the general council s resolutions passed almost unanimously most of them were clearly directed against bakunin and his followers in 1872 the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the hague congress where bakunin and james guillaume were expelled from the international and its headquarters were transferred to new york in response the federalist sections formed their own international at the st imier congress adopting a revolutionary anarchist programme
the paris commune was a government that briefly ruled paris from 18 march more formally from 28 march to 28 may 1871 the commune was the result of an uprising in paris after france was defeated in the francoprussian war anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the paris commune they included louise michel the reclus brothers élie reclus and élisée reclus and eugene varlin the latter murdered in the repression afterwards as for the reforms initiated by the commune such as the reopening of workplaces as cooperatives anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised moreover the commune s ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of proudhon on french radical ideas the commune s vision of a communal france based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes bakunin s and proudhon s ideas proudhon like bakunin had argued in favour of the implementation of the binding mandate in 1848 and for federation of communes thus both economically and politically the paris commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas george woodcock states that a notable contribution to the activities of the commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions including the mutualists courbet longuet and vermorel the libertarian collectivists varlin malon and lefrangais and the bakuninists elie and elisée reclus and louise michel
the antiauthoritarian sections of the first international were the precursors of the anarchosyndicalists seeking to replace the privilege and authority of the state with the free and spontaneous organization of labour in 1886 the federation of organized trades and labor unions of the united states and canada unanimously set 1 may 1886 as the date by which the eighthour work day would become standard
in response unions across the united states prepared a general strike in support of the event on 3 may a fight broke out in chicago when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd the next day on 4 may anarchists staged a rally at chicago s haymarket square a bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally killing an officer in the ensuing panic police opened fire on the crowd and each other seven police officers and at least four workers were killed eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer the men became international political celebrities among the labour movement four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution the incident became known as the haymarket affair and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eighthour day in 1890 a second attempt—this time international in scope—to organise for the eighthour day was made the event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as a result of the haymarket affair although it had initially been conceived as a onceoff event by the following year the celebration of international workers day on may day had become firmly established as an international worker s holiday
in 1907 the international anarchist congress of amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries among which were important figures of the anarchist movement including errico malatesta pierre monatte luigi fabbri benoît broutchoux emma goldman rudolf rocker and christiaan cornelissen various themes were treated during the congress in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement popular education issues the general strike or antimilitarism a central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism or trade unionism malatesta and monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution while malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient he thought that the trade union movement was reformist and even conservative citing as essentially bourgeois and antiworker the phenomenon of professional union officials malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it
in 1881 the spanish workers federation was the first major anarchosyndicalist movement—anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in spain the most successful was the confederación nacional del trabajo national confederation of labour cnt founded in 1910 before the 1940s the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics attracting 158 million members at one point and playing a major role in the spanish civil war the cnt was affiliated with the international workers association a federation of anarchosyndicalist trade unions founded in 1922 with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in europe and latin america in latin america in particular t he anarchists quickly became active in organising craft and industrial workers throughout south and central america and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in mexico brazil peru chile and argentina were anarchosyndicalist in general outlook the prestige of the spanish cnt as a revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation the largest and most militant of these organisations was the federación obrera regional argentina it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions
some anarchists such as johann most advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counterrevolutionaries because we preach not only action in and for itself but also action as propaganda scholars such as beverly gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder but targeted killings of members of the ruling class at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population such as during periods of heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed however most himself once boasted that the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents therefore massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion most is best known for a pamphlet published in 1885 the science of revolutionary warfare a howto manual on the subject of making explosives based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in new jersey
by the 1880s people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan propaganda of the deed to refer to individual bombings regicides and tyrannicides from 1905 onwards the russian counterparts of these antisyndicalist anarchistcommunists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal expropriations illegalism as a practice emerged and within it t he acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins propaganda by the deed and the anarchist burglars individual reappropriation expressed their desperation and their personal violent rejection of an intolerable society moreover they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt france s bonnot gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism
however important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts as soon as 1887 peter kropotkin thus wrote that year in le révolté that a structure based on centuries of history can not be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite a variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action for example through the trade union movement the anarchosyndicalist fernand pelloutier argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without the individual dynamiter
state repression including the infamous 1894 french lois scélérates of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed in the first place to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics although reciprocally state repression may have played a role in these isolated acts the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and—following the suppression of the 1871—paris commune the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts
numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement including tsar alexander ii of russia president sadi carnot of france prime minister antonio cánovas del castillo of spain empress elisabeth of austria king umberto i of italy president william mckinley of the united states king carlos i of portugal and king george i of greece mckinley s assassin leon czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist emma goldman
anarchists participated alongside the bolsheviks in both february and october revolutions and were initially enthusiastic about the bolshevik revolution however following a political falling out with the bolsheviks by the anarchists and other leftwing opposition the conflict culminated in the 1921 kronstadt rebellion which the new government repressed anarchists in central russia were either imprisoned driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks the anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine in the free territory they fought in the civil war against the whites a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the october revolution and then the bolsheviks as part of the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine led by nestor makhno who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months
expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman were among those agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising before they left russia both wrote accounts of their experiences in russia criticising the amount of control the bolsheviks exercised for them bakunin s predictions about the consequences of marxist rule that the rulers of the new socialist marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true
the victory of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example and communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the united states for example members of the major syndicalist movements of the general confederation of labour and industrial workers of the world iww left the organisations and joined the communist international
the revolutionary wave of 1917–1923 saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism in the german uprising known as the german revolution of 1918–1919 which established the bavarian soviet republic the anarchists gustav landauer silvio gesell and erich mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures in the italian events known as the biennio rosso the anarchosyndicalist trade union unione sindacale italiana grew to 800000 members and the influence of the italian anarchist union 20000 members plus umanita nova its daily paper grew accordingly anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces in the mexican revolution the mexican liberal party was established and during the early 1910s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in baja california with the leadership of anarchocommunist ricardo flores magón
in paris the dielo truda group of russian anarchist exiles which included nestor makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of bolshevism their 1926 manifesto called the organisational platform of the general union of anarchists draft was supported platformist groups active today include the workers solidarity movement in ireland and the north eastern federation of anarchist communists of north america synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives in the 1920s this form found as its main proponents volin and sebastien faure it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations
in the 1920s and 1930s the rise of fascism in europe transformed anarchism s conflict with the state italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and benito mussolini s fascists italian anarchists played a key role in the antifascist organisation arditi del popolo which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism such as repelling blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of parma in august 1922 the veteran italian anarchist luigi fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism describing it as the preventive counterrevolution in france where the farright leagues came close to insurrection in the february 1934 riots anarchists divided over a united front policy
anarchists in france and italy were active in the resistance during world war ii in germany the anarchist erich mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 february 1933 within a few hours after the reichstag fire in berlin joseph goebbels the nazi propaganda minister labelled him as one of those jewish subversives over the next seventeen months he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at sonnenburg brandenburg and finally oranienburg on 2 february 1934 mühsam was transferred to the concentration camp at oranienburg when finally on the night of 9 july 1934 mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning
in spain the national anarchosyndicalist trade union cnt initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by cnt supporters led to a rightwing election victory in 1936 the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power months later conservative members of the military with the support of minority extremeright parties responded with an attempted coup causing the spanish civil war 1936–1939 in response to the army rebellion an anarchistinspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land however the anarchists were losing ground even before the fascist victory in 1939 in a bitter struggle with the stalinists who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the republicans cause from the soviet union according to noam chomsky the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the spanish anarchists not just in catalonia—the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere the communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the republic and were very much opposed to the anarchists partially because stalin still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with western countries against adolf hitler that failed and stalin withdrew the support to the republic they even withdrew the spanish gold reserves the events known as the spanish revolution was a workers social revolution that began during the outbreak of the spanish civil war in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years primarily catalonia aragon andalusia and parts of levante much of spain s economy was put under worker control and in anarchist strongholds like catalonia the figure was as high as 75 but lower in areas with heavy communist party of spain influence as the sovietallied party actively resisted attempts at collectivisation enactment factories were run through worker committees agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes anarchist historian sam dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the spanish revolution which he claimed came closer to realising the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history spanish communist partyled troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident marxists and anarchists the prominent italian anarchist camillo berneri who volunteered to fight against francisco franco was killed instead in spain by gunmen associated with the spanish communist party the city of madrid was turned over to the francoist forces by the last nonfrancoist mayor of the city the anarchist melchor rodríguez garcía
anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of italy and france the mexican anarchist federation was established in 1945 after the anarchist federation of the centre united with the anarchist federation of the federal district in the early 1940s the antifascist international solidarity and the federation of anarchist groups of cuba merged into the large national organisation asociación libertaria de cuba cuban libertarian association from 1944 to 1947 the bulgarian anarchist communist federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement but was repressed by the new communist regime in 1945 in france the fédération anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade union confédération nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist federazione anarchica italiana was founded in italy korean anarchists formed the league of free social constructors in september 1945 and in 1946 the japanese anarchist federation was founded an international anarchist congress with delegates from across europe was held in paris in may 1948 after world war ii an appeal in the fraye arbeter shtime detailing the plight of german anarchists and called for americans to support them by february 1946 the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in germany was a largescale operation the federation of libertarian socialists was founded in germany in 1947 and rudolf rocker wrote for its organ die freie gesellschaft which survived until 1953 in 1956 the uruguayan anarchist federation was founded in 1955 the anarchocommunist federation of argentina renamed itself as the argentine libertarian federation the syndicalist workers federation swf was a syndicalist group in active in postwar britain and one of solidarity federation s earliest predecessors it was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved anarchist federation of britain afb unlike the afb which was influenced by anarchosyndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself the swf decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist workercentred strategy from the outset
anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time such as albert camus herbert read paul goodman dwight macdonald allen ginsberg george woodcock leopold kohr julian beck john cage and the french surrealist group led by andré breton which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the fédération anarchiste
anarchopacifism became influential in the antinuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the english anarchist member of campaign for nuclear disarmament alex comfort or the similar activism of the american catholic anarchopacifists ammon hennacy and dorothy day anarchopacifism became a basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the cold war the resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in robert graham s volume two the emergence of the new anarchism 1939–1977
a surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s anarchism was influential in the counterculture of the 1960s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts in 1968 in carrara italy the international of anarchist federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing european federations of france the fédération anarchiste the federazione anarchica italiana of italy and the iberian anarchist federation as well as the bulgarian federation in french exile
in the united kingdom in the 1970s this was associated with the punk rock movement as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols the housing and employment crisis in most of western europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of barcelona spain in denmark squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the freetown christiania an autonomous haven in central copenhagen since the revival of anarchism in the mid20th century a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarchafeminism they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s anarchist anthropologist david graeber and anarchist historian andrej grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism with those who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are much more informed among other elements by indigenous feminist ecological and culturalcritical ideas and who by the turn of the 21st century formed by far the majority of anarchists
since the 1980s anarchism has grown into a strong political force in latin america with the development of fejuve 1979 ciporfm 1980s zapatistas 1994 horizontilidad 2001 and the oaxaca uprising 2006 around the turn of the 21st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the antiwar anticapitalist and antiglobalisation movements anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the world trade organization wto group of eight g8 and the world economic forum wef some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with police these actions were precipitated by ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs—other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet a significant event of this period was the confrontations at wto conference in seattle in 1999 according to anarchist scholar simon critchley contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudolibertarianism of contemporary neoliberalism one might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility whether sexual ecological or socioeconomic it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the west ravages the rest it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally
international anarchist federations in existence include the international of anarchist federations the international workers association and international libertarian solidarity the largest organised anarchist movement today is in spain in the form of the confederación general del trabajo cgt and the cnt cgt membership was estimated at around 100000 for 2003
anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the democratic federation of northern syria dfns more commonly known as rojava a de facto autonomous region in northern syria abdullah öcalan—a founding member of the kurdistan workers party pkk who is currently imprisoned in turkey—is an iconic and popular figure in the dfns whose ideas shaped the region s society and politics while in prison öcalan corresponded with and was influenced by murray bookchin an anarchocommunist theorist and philosopher who developed communalism and libertarian municipalism modelled after bookchin s ideas öcalan developed the theory of democratic confederalism in march 2005 he issued his declaration of democratic confederalism in kurdistan calling upon citizens to stop attacking the government and instead create municipal assemblies which he called democracy without the state
anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions individualist anarchism and social anarchism which have some different origins values and evolution the individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty ie opposition to state or social control over the individual while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one s potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil recognising equality of entitlement in a chronological and theoretical sense there are classical—those created throughout the 19th century—and postclassical anarchist schools—those created since the mid20th century and after
beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it a component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate and usually temporary necessary evil but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration first adopted by fernando tarrida del mármol in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time in abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms ie collectivist communist mutualist– and individualistanarchism it sought to emphasise the antiauthoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought
mutualism began in 18thcentury english and french labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with pierrejoseph proudhon in france and others in the united states proudhon proposed spontaneous order whereby organisation emerges without central authority a positive anarchy where order arises when everybody does what he wishes and only what he wishes and where business transactions alone produce the social order proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance for this reason much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous selfgovernance proudhon was heavily involved in french parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers movements and in addition to advocating stateprotected charters for workerowned cooperatives promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service
mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform according to the american mutualist william batchelder greene each worker in the mutualist system would receive just and exact pay for his work services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost without profit or discount mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society the synthesis of communism and property
social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations without any government authority or coercion it is the largest school of thought in anarchism social anarchism rejects private property seeing it as a source of social inequality while retaining respect for personal property and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid organization mutual aid
collectivist anarchism also referred to as revolutionary socialism or a form of such is a revolutionary form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin and johann most collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production instead advocating that ownership be collectivised this was to be achieved through violent revolution first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence or propaganda by the deed which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production
however collectivisation was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarchocommunism this position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively uphold ing the wages system collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with marxism but opposed the marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society anarchist communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive —although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour some held out the possibility of a postrevolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need
file kropotkin2jpgthumbupright peter kropotkin was influential in the development of anarchocommunism
